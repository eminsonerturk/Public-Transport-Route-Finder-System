# Public-Transport-Route-Finder-System
  Analysis of a route finding application by some kind of public transport
  
  Public Transport Route Finder (PTRF) is a mobile application with an active Internet connection, which can be used by 
people living in many different cities all over the world. Main aim of the application is to suggest the available public 
transport routes between two given points in a city. Depending on the means of public transport available in a city, it can 
suggest different kinds of transport types including railway, land vehicles (city busses, private buses, etc.) and sea 
transport. If the stations (bus stops, etc.) of two consecutive vehicles to be used are within walking distance, the system
should also show the shortest path to be walked to reach the next station on the route. It should also be possible to add 
new public transport types and update the existing ones in each city.
   
   The use case to be implemented is showing the available transport routes between two points chosen by the user.
